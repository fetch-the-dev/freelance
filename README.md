# Freelance Web Developer Landing Page  

This is just my personal site. I use it to test different web tools and services while figuring out what works best for client projects. It’s also a simple way to show what I do as a freelance web developer working with design agencies.  

### Why I Made This  
- **Testing Ground:** I try out services like Google Analytics, Maze.co, and other tools to see how they work before recommending them to clients.  
- **Developer Experiments:** Sometimes I test simple solutions, like using Google Analytics for basic site downtime monitoring. It’s not perfect, but it’s a quick way to keep an eye on things.  
- **Freelance Work:** The page itself is clean, professional, and designed to be straightforward—just like the websites I build for agencies.  

### Feel Free to Use It  
If you want to copy or tweak this for your own use, go for it. I don’t mind.  

### Questions?  
If you're curious about how or why I’m testing something, feel free to ask. Always happy to share what I learn.  

### License  
Use it however you want.
